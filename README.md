# Optimizing a 2048 AI with Genetic Algorithms
This repository contains the implementation of a Genetic Algorithm designed to create a Neural Network that plays the 2048 game. To run the algorithm, simply open the main.py file, edit the parameters specified there and execute it. 

The following libraries are needed to run this project:

* Numpy
* Keras
* Pandas
* Pygame

The code for the original 2048 game was adapted from [here](https://gist.github.com/lewisjdeane/752eeba4635b479f8bb2).
